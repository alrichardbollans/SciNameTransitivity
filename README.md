## TaxoDrift

In botanical research, and biological research more broadly, taxonomic names change frequently due to new discoveries, updated classifications, and
revised nomenclature rules. **TaxoDrift** is a project aimed at analyzing and understanding the phenomenon of taxonomic drift and nomenclature changes
in botanical research.
This repository explores how taxonomic databases evolve over time and focuses on the following aspects:

- Identifying and understanding taxonomic drift across different database versions.
- Analyzing the impact of nomenclature changes on data standardization.
